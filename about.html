			Alissa Moore is the owner and operator of Personal Best Fitness. She has been training in the Louisville/Southern Indiana area since 1999. Her passion of fitness and desire to help others began during her time spent as a high school and collegiate cheerleader and powerlifter. <br /> <br />
			Alissa holds a Masters degree in Exercise Physiology from the University of Louisville and an undergraduate degree in Sports Medicine from the University of Evansville. She is a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist, certified by the National Strength and Conditioning Association. <br /> <br />

She trains individuals from age 4 to 104, and can help those who need "special" care, from either a recent injury, or from a life-long condition.<br /><br />
